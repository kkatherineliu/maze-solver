# Maze Solver
This program reads a text file as input to generate a maze with random start and end positions. It also provides a visualization of the BFS that it uses to solve the maze.

Note: when prompted for input, please enter one of "maze1" "maze2" "maze3" or "maze4" (or create your own maze with the same structure of spaces as paths and # as the walls).

Here is a short demo of the program:

If you want to try it out yourself, just download the files and run the code from MazeSolver.java
